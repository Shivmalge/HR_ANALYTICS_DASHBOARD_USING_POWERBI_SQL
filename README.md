  - The active employee count stands at 1,233, with an average employee age of 37 years, indicating a mature and experienced workforce.
  - Department-wise attrition is highest in Research & Development (56.12%), followed by Sales (38.82%), while HR reports the lowest attrition (5.06%), highlighting areas that may need   targeted retention strategies.
  - The largest employee group by age is 25–34 years, with 337 males and 217 females, suggesting a young and mid-career dominant workforce.
  - Job satisfaction appears highest among Sales Executives, with 112 employees rating satisfaction as 4 on the scale, indicating a relatively satisfied segment.
  - In terms of education fields, Life Sciences and IT contribute most to attrition (89 employees), whereas HR shows the least attrition (7 employees), signaling potential mismatch or expectations in specific fields.

##### Overall, the dashboard reveals focused areas where HR can implement retention strategies—especially in high-attrition departments like R&D and Sales—and improve engagement based on age group and education field dynamics.
